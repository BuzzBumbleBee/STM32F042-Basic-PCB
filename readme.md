# Basic STM32F042 breakout baord

This is built around the 20pin STM32F042 package.

features :

* Crystal less USB


Note this is a vary basic desing and lacks a lot things needed
for somthing to use outside of the lab, like ...

* USB ESD protection
* Polarity protection diode
* BOOT0 tied to ground via a 10k or so resistor



The main goal of this project was to get a working STM32 system
with minimal componentss
